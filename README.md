# EliteML: End-to-End House Price Prediction with MLOps

## Overview

EliteML is a comprehensive project showcasing an end-to-end machine learning workflow for predicting house prices using advanced MLOps techniques. The project integrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, deployment, and monitoring, highlighting the robustness and scalability of modern ML systems.

## Features

- **Data Pipeline**: Automated data collection, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights into key features influencing house prices.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Deployment**: Deployment using MLOps frameworks for scalable and continuous integration.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Real-time performance tracking and model retraining.

## Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**: Data sourced from public datasets (e.g., Kaggle's House Price Dataset).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization.
3. **Modeling**: Algorithms used include Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **MLOps Framework**: Utilized tools like MLflow, Docker, and Kubernetes.
5. **Deployment**: Hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Import data using APIs or CSV files.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Normalize numerical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identify trends and correlations.
   - Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. **Model Training**:
   - Train models with hyperparameter tuning.
   - Evaluate using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R2.
5. **Deployment**:
   - Containerize the model using Docker.
   - Deploy using Flask or FastAPI.
6. **Monitoring**:
   - Track metrics and log data using MLflow.
   - Retrain models based on new data.

## Installation
